This is a playpen implementation of the Blockly visual programming language.
For information on Blockly, see http://code.google.com/p/blockly
Note : I am not affiliated with Blockly in any way.

To use, open the math.html file in your web browser. Note: Chrome may have 
problems using local files so I suggest you use Firefox instead if you encounter
problems.

As a starting point, I suggest connecting a "print" block from the Text menu to
a number block from the Math menu and then pressing the "Run Program" button.

For things to do, try Project Euler ( http://projecteuler.net/ )
